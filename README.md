**Challenge** 
Adventure Work Store seeks to understand its sales performance compared to budget, understand customer behavior, products, and identify areas for improvement. They have a database with data distributed across multiple tables, making it difficult to extract meaningful insights.

**Method**
The store needs to use SQL queries to extract data from various tables, perform calculations, Joins and aggregate data to obtain meaningful insights.

2. Excel - The queries will be exported to excel for easier access and use of the management.
3. Power BI - Visualization of KPIs and Metrics to help executive in Data Driven Decision Making.

**Solution**
To solve the problem, SQL queries were written to retrieve data from various tables and join them to obtain insights. Different SQL functions and clauses were used to manipulate the data, perform calculations, and aggregate results. Once  the required data was collected, it was imported into Excel for further analysis and a dashboard in Power BI is created for visualization. By analyzing the data, Management can gain insights into customer preferences, identify popular products and categories, and monitor sales trends compared to budget.
